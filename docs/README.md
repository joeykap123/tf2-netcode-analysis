# Overview
This project seeks to analyze various networking principles in Team Fortress 2, a game by Valve. Within this project, we will explore networking concepts and how they relate to online gaming. We will also explore phenomenons of cheating and how these methods are executed.
> !NOTE
> This project is under active development and will be expanded with additional simulations and analysis.

# data Folder

## Overview of data.json
**data.json** contains JSON style data that can be parsed and given to various mathematical functions to understand lag compensation and interpolation. 

> !NOTE
>
> All datasets in this project are **made-up, synthetic examples** created for testing and visualization.  
> No real network traffic or gameplay data was collected.
