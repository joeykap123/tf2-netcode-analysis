# Overview
This project seeks to analyze various networking principles in Team Fortress 2, a game by Valve. </br>
(i.e., highlight use of UDP creates ambiguity between cheating and simple packet loss, but not main goal of project.)
</br>

> !NOTE
> **Disclaimer**
>
> This project is strictly for educational and research purposes. It is a simulation and study of how network latency, packet loss, and interpolation affect client-side perception of player position in games using UDP.
>
> **No part of this project is intended for cheating or exploitation in live games.** It does not interact with real game servers, and using similar techniques on live servers may violate game terms of service and applicable laws.
>
> The goal is to understand the mathematics and network behavior behind lag compensation and interpolation in a controlled, offline environment.

It **does not** interact with Steam, the Team Fortress 2 client, or live servers, and it must **not** be used to create or distribute cheats or exploits.

Interpolation/Extrapolation Issues </br>
UDP Based Cheat Issues </br>
Network Attacks on Games </br>
TF2 Interpolation settings/eploit </br> 

Handle simulation of packet loss and interpolation to avoid creating entire server/client model</br>

Handle lag compensation and interpolation mainly. Can reference interp cheating, but that is not primary goal of project.
