# Overview
This project seeks to analyze what "Interp Cheating" is and how this technique relates to Networking principles.
(i.e., use of UDP creates ambiguity between cheating and simple packet loss)

Interpolation/Extrapolation Issues </br>
UDP Based Cheat Issues </br>
Network Attacks on Games </br>
TF2 Interpolation settings/eploit </br> 

Handle simulation of packet loss and interpolation to avoid creating entire server/client model
