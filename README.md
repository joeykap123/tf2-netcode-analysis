# Overview
This project seeks to analyze various networking principles in Team Fortress 2, a game by Valve. Within this project, we will explore networking concepts and how they relate to online gaming. We will also explore phenomenons of cheating and how these methods are executed.</br>

> **Disclaimer**
>
> This project is strictly for educational and research purposes. It is a simulation and study of how network latency, packet loss, and interpolation affect client-side perception of player position in games using UDP.
>
> **No part of this project is intended for cheating or exploitation in live games.** It does not interact with real game servers, and using similar techniques on live servers may violate game terms of service and applicable laws.
>
> The goal is to understand the mathematics and network behavior behind lag compensation and interpolation in a controlled, offline environment.

## Overview of data.json
**data.json** contains JSON style data that can be parsed and given to various mathematical functions to understand lag compensation and interpolation. 

> !NOTE
>
> All datasets in this project are **made-up, synthetic examples** created for testing and visualization.  
> No real network traffic or gameplay data was collected.
