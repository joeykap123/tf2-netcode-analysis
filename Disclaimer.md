This project is strictly for **educational and research** purposes. It is a simulation and study of how network latency, packet loss, and interpolation affect client-side perception of player position in games that use UDP. The repository:

- Does **not** interact with Steam, the Team Fortress 2 client, or any live servers.
- Does **not** include any runtime hooks, memory editing code, DLLs, or instructions to modify live game clients.
- Must **not** be used to create, distribute, or enable cheats, hacks, or exploits.

Running or adapting code from this repository against live game clients or servers may violate Valve’s Steam Subscriber Agreement, VAC policies, and applicable laws. The author explicitly discourages and disclaims any misuse of the provided code or derivatives for illicit or harmful activities.
